I'm currently a Web Developer on the Digital User Experience team in the ITS Communication dept at the University of Michigan.
Currently working on more Drupal than other web frameworks, I have experience in WordPress, Laravel, and any PHP custom coding for
websites or web apps. I've had a strong attention towards accessibility and have done training with Karl Groves and Tenon. I've
more recently delved into more frontend systems also, like React, Vue.js and static sites like this one built on Astro.js. I was
able to roll out some quick, simple, novelty sites like those found in my [project list](/projects). Check those out to see some
of what I've done. Hopefully I'll have more exciting things to share here too.
