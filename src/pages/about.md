Hi there! My name is Joseph, and I have been programming for more than two decades. Now focused on web development with a passion for creating innovative solutions to real-world problems. With over 16 years of professional experience in the field, I have honed my skills in a variety of areas, such as programming both backend and frontend, DevOps, InfoSec, and productivity systems.

I spent the last 8 years working at Zingerman's as a web developer, where I had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects. Some of my proudest accomplishments during this time was creating a customer and employee pre-order system for the bakery, which replaced the old paper system and helped streamline the ordering process and sourcing and implementing modern development systems for our WordPress sites built on Roots.io projects Bedrock and Sage. Additionally, I developed classes, presentations, and workshops to teach marketers from 11 different companies about marketing operations, tools, and technologies such as accessibility, search engine optimization, HTML, Google Analytics, and online review monitoring.

In my previous role at Trends International, LLC, I was a Programmer/EDI Analyst where I played a major role in implementing the Total Retail Services (TRS) platform, an internal system for our retail inventory teams across the country. I also migrated the website from Miva Merchant to LemonStand and  developed bespoke modules for it, including a PayFlow Pro payment processor using their API.

One of the things I love most about programming is that there's always something new to learn. No matter how much experience you have, there's always a new challenge to tackle, a new tool to master, or a new technique to try. That's why I'm always seeking out new ways to expand my skill set and stay on the cutting edge of the industry.

When I'm not working, I love to indulge in a few of my favorite hobbies. I'm a big fan of TV, movies, and video games, and I also enjoy board games and escape rooms. I love to cook, eat new and interesting foods, and make and learn about classic cocktails.  I find that these activities help me to recharge my batteries and stay fresh and focused when I'm back at my desk.

If you're interested in working with me or learning more about what I do, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm always happy to chat with fellow programmers, potential clients, or anyone who shares my passion for technology and problem solving. Thanks for stopping by!
