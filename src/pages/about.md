Hi, my name is Joseph. I currently live in Ypsilanti, Michigan and love programming and problem solving. Been working on or in 
programming for the better part of the last two decades. Leaning towards web for the last 15 years I am a full stack developer with
a focus on backend development in PHP.
 
I've primarily worked with WordPress and Drupal but have also worked with other PHP libraries in various projects. I am also comfortable in frontend 
development working with JavaScript. Mostly jQuery but am eager to learn new technologies and have been working on React and Vue to grow with the industry.

Outside of work I spend my time with TV, movies, video games, board games, and escape rooms.
