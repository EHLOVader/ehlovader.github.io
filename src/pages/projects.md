Welcome, these are a few of the projects I've worked on. I've tried to include a few details about each project, but if 
you have any questions please feel free to reach out.

## [bookmarklet.meme](https://bookmarklet.meme) ![New](https://img.shields.io/badge/new-FF9900)
A simple website that provides bookmarklets for overlaying memes on websites. It's a fun project that
I came up with when I was browsing websites that made me feel the emotion of a meme. I wanted to be able
to share or show that, even if just to me to express the frustration or joy I was feeling at the moment.

## [Astro Cloudflare Error Pages](https://github.com/EHLOVader/astro-cloudflare-error)
Cloudflare supports custom error pages, so you can style them to look on brand. You just have to host them somewhere for 
Cloudflare to grab a copy and cache them. With AstroJS and Github pages, it's easy to host these pages and style them too. 

## [Who Knows LOL](https://ehlovader.github.io/whoknowslol/)
Back when I was on IRC more frequently, another developer, [Chris White](https://github.com/cwhite92), came up with the 
idea for a more intense shrug emoji for when you really don't know. He created it initially and I added some fun effects 
like wrapping into block and automatically copying the shrug once you've set it.

## [Is it daylight saving?](https://isitdaylightsaving.com/)
I've often caught myself wondering if were in the saving time or not. I created this site to check based on the user's 
browser timezone if currently the time is saving or standard. [view source at GitHub](https://github.com/EHLOVader/isitdaylightsaving) 

## [2023 NYE countdown for  AdaFruit EyeLights LED Glasses](https://github.com/EHLOVader/eyelights_newyear_countdown)
A fork from [willgorman](https://github.com/willgorman) I updated the countdown code to work for the current year and changed the colors. Did a bit of cleaning up too, including the libraries.

## [Laravel Elixir Livereload](https://github.com/EHLOVader/laravel-elixir-livereload)
Created this NPM package to use livereload in elixir back when that was used. 
Elixir was changed to Mix shortly after I created this package.
