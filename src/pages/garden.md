Here you will find some things that I've created that don't quite fit into projects, and aren't created frequently enough 
for me to call it a blog. Some guides, information, and other things that I've learned and want to share.

## Talks
### [Two Modern Tools To Improve Your Wordpress Development Workflow ](https://github.com/EHLOVader/wordcamp2019)
#### Lightning talk at WordCamp Ann Arbor 2019
I will share two tools that have changed how I work on WordPress sites. Roots.ioâ€™s Bedrock and Sage 9 starter theme are a quick way to jump into more modern workflow. Both are packed with many tools and technologies, we will look at a handful of my favorites and how they have changed my work for the better.

## Guides
### MacOS developer setup (_coming soon_)
I've used HomeBrew and other tools to setup a MacOS developer environment that I'm happy with. I'll be sharing my setup process and tools I use.

## InfoSec
These are two security advisories I disclosed for LemonStand ( [sadly no longer with us](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/before-breaking-up-with-shopify-mailchimp-quietly-acqui-hired-lemonstand-a-shopify-competitor/) )
* [Null Byte Poisoning within LemonStand ecommerce platform](https://gist.github.com/EHLOVader/343103dcb454d41bbe18)
* [Session injection/hijacking LemonStand ecommerce platform](https://gist.github.com/EHLOVader/7851a055454f1749e922)
 
## Blog
yeah I know I said this wasn't a blog, but I've written a few things that I think are worth sharing.
### [Slow Food Movement for the Web](https://ehlovader.github.io/slow-food-movement-for-the-web/)

## Random

### [RFC specifications that people miss in email validation](https://gist.github.com/EHLOVader/4531693)
I want to use gmail's plus notation in my email on accounts but so many applications fail on the `+` I created this pedantic
form letter of the RFC spec that are often missed.

### [Personal OhShitGit tips](https://gist.github.com/EHLOVader/4d71826db94d56e64bce4785e4b68280)
I loved https://ohshitgit.com/ and have been referring to it for awhile now. But since they aren't widely open to contributions
I thought a fork of sorts would be nice to store the few new tips or issues I've run into and found a fix for. So here I've placed them in a gist. 

### [Somewhat Classic Hangman](https://ehlovader.github.io/hangman/)
This is a hangman game I created in highschool. It is playable here with [js-dos](https://js-dos.com) 
I made the images, character sprites, and built the interface with ascii characters. It was made in qBasic, a langauge I'd learned on my own from the manual I found in my home PC windows system folders. 
I've also explained a bit of how it is made.
