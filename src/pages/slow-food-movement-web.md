# Slow food movement for the Web

What makes the slow food movement so compelling and great for the restaurant industry and food makers is not just good for food but can be applied to the web and design projects for many of the same reasons.

Like some of the best food, designing a successful website, web application, company image or online presence takes time. Although we are all aware of the importance of deadlines and budgets, hurrying the web development process usually results in an inferior or inherently flawed product. A product that misses the mark, can increase future maintenance costs or impact the business’s image poorly.

## Bringing craft back to code
What can we do to prevent this?

1. ### Return to the artifact
When we are making anything we need the right systems to do it with or in. What we make will be an artifact, it will exist Using the wrong materials or the wrong tools to create an artifact will result in something that won’t work well or will come with many unforeseen problems.

2. ### Value both kinds of users
We aren’t just making things for one audience, though. We make them for the content creators and for our end customers. It is important to keep each of the users of an artifact in mind, through the planning, creating and ultimate using of the product. Applying the wrong tools, with only one of these users in mind the result would be a disservice to both.

3. ### Work in craftsman’s time
The process we want, to produce an artifact of the desired quality, must take time. Like a good bread, cheese, or prepared meal; these things take time and cannot be rushed. Just like any one of these, if cut short, rushed, or given compressed timelines the results will not be the quality it should be.

4. ### Ship small but excellent
The key to this process is to work from large to small but ship small to large. It is important to make sure we have solved the big problems first, don’t get hung up on small details too soon in the process. Focusing on the smaller details too soon could prevent us from ensuring the large ones aren’t solved. Despite planning large to small we must ship small to large. A minimum viable product which must be narrow enough of scope to be executed with excellence.

5. ### Respect deep knowledge
Finding the masters of our work. Following traditions and staying abreast of news. We follow all of these ourselves and try to do our best to find ways to apply the newest and best technologies in our projects.
